These account names identify the connected accounts but are used only to perform the requested synchronization.",
      "When you submit a solution, CodeVault reads the accepted submission's source code and basic problem metadata from the supported coding platform so it can create or update the matching file in your GitHub repository.",
      "A pending submission witness may remain in Chrome extension storage for up to fifteen minutes while CodeVault waits for the verdict. If an accepted solution cannot reach GitHub immediately, its retry record, including any captured source code, may remain locally for up to twenty-four hours or until synchronization succeeds.",

      "CodeVault reads only LeetCode's named CSRF cookie when LeetCode requires it as a request header. That value is never sent to GitHub or to the CodeVault OAuth service.",
      "The OAuth service at code-vault-tan.vercel.app performs the GitHub authorization exchange. OAuth state expires after five minutes, and the encrypted one-time token exchange expires after sixty seconds. The service also keeps short-lived rate-limit records to prevent abuse.",
      "The website and OAuth service are hosted by Vercel, which may process standard request metadata such as an IP address. To prevent abuse, CodeVault hashes the request IP before storing a rate-limit counter in Upstash Redis for up to ten minutes. Upstash also stores only short-lived OAuth state and encrypted one-time exchange data needed to complete the connection flow.",
